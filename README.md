Here is a sample README file for a collection of Java programs demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. You can customize it based on your project structure and specific programs.

# OOP Concepts in Java

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Java programs designed to demonstrate the key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). These concepts include:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**
- **Constructors**
- **Static Members**
- **Interfaces**
- **Abstract Classes**

Each program focuses on a specific concept or a combination of concepts to help build a deeper understanding of how OOP is implemented in Java.

## Prerequisites

- JDK installed (version 8 or above)
- Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans) or a simple text editor and terminal

## OOP Concepts and Program Files

### 1. Classes and Objects
- **Program**: `ClassObjectDemo.java`
- **Description**: This program demonstrates the creation of classes, objects, and methods.

### 2. Encapsulation
- **Program**: `EncapsulationDemo.java`
- **Description**: Shows how encapsulation is achieved by making class fields private and providing public getter and setter methods.

### 3. Inheritance
- **Program**: `InheritanceDemo.java`
- **Description**: Demonstrates inheritance, where a class inherits properties and behaviors from another class.

### 4. Polymorphism
- **Program**: `PolymorphismDemo.java`
- **Description**: Covers both compile-time (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding).

### 5. Abstraction
- **Program**: `AbstractionDemo.java`
- **Description**: Shows the use of abstract classes and abstract methods to achieve abstraction.

### 6. Constructors
- **Program**: `ConstructorDemo.java`
- **Description**: Explains the role of constructors in Java, including parameterized constructors.

### 7. Static Members
- **Program**: `StaticDemo.java`
- **Description**: Illustrates the use of static methods and static variables in Java.

### 8. Interfaces
- **Program**: `InterfaceDemo.java`
- **Description**: Demonstrates how interfaces work and how they are used for achieving multiple inheritance in Java.

### 9. Abstract Classes
- **Program**: `AbstractClassDemo.java`
- **Description**: Focuses on the concept of abstract classes, which allow for some implementation and some abstract methods.

## How to Run the Programs

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the directory where the specific Java file is located.
   
3. Compile the Java program:
    ```bash
    javac <filename>.java
    ```

4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    java <filename>
    ```

For example, to run the `InheritanceDemo.java`:
```bash
javac InheritanceDemo.java
java InheritanceDemo
```
