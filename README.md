# OOP Concepts in Java

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Java programs designed to demonstrate the key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). These concepts include:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**
- **Constructors**
- **Static Members**
- **Interfaces**
- **Abstract Classes**

Each program focuses on a specific concept or a combination of concepts to help build a deeper understanding of how OOP is implemented in Java.

## Prerequisites

- JDK installed (version 8 or above)
- Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans) or a simple text editor and terminal

## How to Run the Programs

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the directory where the specific Java file is located.
   
3. Compile the Java program:
    ```bash
    javac <filename>.java
    ```

4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    java <filename>
    ```

For example, to run the `InheritanceDemo.java`:
```bash
javac InheritanceDemo.java
java InheritanceDemo
```
